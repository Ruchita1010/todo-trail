## Roadmap

- Implement user authentication functionality

- Display message when the required input fields are empty
- Sorting functionality to allow users to sort the todos according to the priority
- Reordering todos functionality to allow users to reorder the todos
- Dark mode

## Known Issues

- Shared data, making it accessible to everyone to view the projects/todos
- Duplicate project titles leading to unexpected behavior

## Learnings

- new array method: flat()
- got familiar with date-fns and uuid libraries
- event propagation (ended up not using e.stopPropagation() though!!)
- first time used a data attribute ðŸ˜… and that too setting it with javascript.
- e.currentTarget (It always refers to the element to which the event handler has been attached, as opposed to e.target, which identifies the element on which the event occurred and which may be its descendant)
- adding tooltips
- strengthen my grid skills
